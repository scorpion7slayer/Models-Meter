# Models Meter Privacy Policy

Last updated: July 30, 2026

Models Meter is designed so the iOS developer does not collect user data. The
app has no analytics, advertising, tracking, developer-operated account system,
or application relay server.

## Authentication and OpenAI services

When the user chooses to sign in, Models Meter uses OpenAI’s device
authorization service. Authenticated requests travel directly between the
device and OpenAI to load Codex allowance, reset times, reset-credit inventory,
and to redeem a reset credit after confirmation.

OpenAI may process information under its own privacy policy and terms. Codex
Meter does not receive a copy on a developer-controlled server. See the
[OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy/).

## Information stored on the device

- OAuth access, refresh, and identity tokens are stored in Apple Keychain.
- The last successful usage response is cached locally for offline display.
- Bounded five-hour and weekly percentage samples are stored locally to draw
  burn charts and improve pace estimates. They contain no tokens or account
  identifiers and can be cleared independently in the app.
- Notification and appearance preferences remain on the device.
- Widgets receive only percentages, reset dates, plan label, update time, and
  reset-credit count.

Widgets never receive OAuth credentials, account identifiers, or reset-credit
IDs.

## Notifications and diagnostics

Notifications are scheduled locally after permission is granted. Models Meter
does not include a crash-reporting or telemetry SDK and does not transmit app
interaction, advertising, or diagnostic data to the developer.

## Retention, deletion, and choices

Local cache data remains until it is replaced or the user signs out. Local burn
history can also be cleared at any time without signing out. Choosing Sign Out
removes credentials, cached account data, burn history, pending background work,
and scheduled notifications from the device. The app also attempts to revoke
the OpenAI refresh token; local deletion succeeds even when the network is
unavailable. Settings exports are created only when requested and contain
preferences—not credentials or usage samples.

Demo mode is entirely local and does not contact OpenAI. Notification
permission is optional.

## Children, changes, and contact

Models Meter is not directed to children and does not knowingly collect personal
information from children. Material changes will be posted with a revised date.

For privacy or support questions, contact

Models Meter is unofficial and is not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenAI.
